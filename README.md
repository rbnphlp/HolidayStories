# Web app to add & share your future holidays


The project as part of Module3:Code Institute  .


Backend built on MongoDB , with AmazonS3 for Picture Storage and Flask Frame work.
UI is built on Materialise Framework.



## UX Design 

+ The Skeleton Layout:


    - A HomePage : Page explaining User needs and Web app Goals  
    - Holiday Tales Page : Page to display initial cover Images of Holidays along with a Title , likes & No of Images uploaded   
    - Add a Holiday : A form page which allows users to add Holidays with a Title and Description (available as FAB at the bottom of page)
    - Add  Memories : A fom page which allows users to add Memories with Title and Description (available as FAB at the bottom of page)
    - Subsuquent Edit and Delete Pages from the above
    - Memories : Page displaying a carousel of Memories in a card image

Initial wireframe used for developing a prototype :

## DB Design 

+ The MongoDb had two collections , Holidays and Memories :
    - Holidays Collection simply containg the title and Destination along with upvotes info
    - Memories Collection had the corresponding memory title , description , image url link along with each memory referencing the Holidays Collection by the unique        id.This allowed , to keep the Memories collection relatively small  and well within limit of 16MB for future uploads
    - Images are uploaded initially captured from form uploads , processed and uploaded to s3 using boto3.The corresponding link is then inserted along with form aguments to MongoDB for future retrieval. Any additional image uploaded for a same memory  will simply be replaced with the most recent image. And hence , Each Memory has one image with each holiday having multiple Memories.

## User Stories

> "*I want to see others who visited a destination I am instrested in for a holiday , and things they did* "

> "*I want to share my holiday memories  for others to feedback * "

> "*I  want a collage of memories of my favourite Holidays which tells a story *"
